I want you to build me a fully responsive, modern, animated website for a barbershop called Authentic Cuts Barbershop. This is not a basic site — I need it to feel premium, sleek, and alive. Put a lot of focus on the following key principles:

🔷 MUST-HAVE DESIGN EMPHASIS:
Modern: Sleek, sharp UI using a clean sans-serif font, a cool blue-light color theme, and smart layout decisions.

Clean: Maximize whitespace, avoid clutter, use clear hierarchy with polished visual structure.

Animations EVERYWHERE: Add subtle but stylish animations — scroll reveals, fade-ins, hover effects, animated transitions between sections. Make every interaction feel smooth and deliberate.

All buttons should have rounded corners (no sharp edges).

📦 Functional Requirements:
Build the project with clean file structure so it can be deployed directly to Vercel.

No contact forms. Don’t add any contact form at all.

Include a live, embedded Google Maps section that shows the barbershop’s location. Here's the map link:
